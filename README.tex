\title{IEEE@UCR Member\_SignIn}
\author{Brandon Lu}
\maketitle

This document is written in order to provide some form of documentation for
the IEEE@UCR Member\_SignIn system.  Although design rationale will be
covered, please note that that is not the main purpose of this document,
and that further details about implementation and a large amount of jokes
can be ``bought over'' by treating the author to a meal.  He may also follow
you home, so please be wise.

Please note that this document is written in a ``backwards fashion'' with the 
logic that it may be read from the most-used portion to the least used
portion.

Please also note that this document is probably going to be under active
construction for a long, long time.

\section{Operation}
This section primarily details how to use the system.  If everything is set up
correctly, it's pretty simple.
	\subsection{Primary Authentication}
\begin{figure}[h]

Please swipe your card or press enter for manual entry.\\

\caption{Primary authentication mode.}
\label{fig:pauth}
\end{figure}
Primary authentication can be completed in one of two ways.  An example of
the screen that will be seen in this first mode is seen at Figure
\ref{fig:pauth}.
		\subsubsection{Card Swipe}
Card swipe authentication is achieved by reading the input from stdin provided
by a standard card reader on the student's ID.  Be sure your keyboard is set
to ``us,'' this has become a problem in the past with administrators who have
their keyboards set to something other than ``us.''

The specifics can be found in the code if necessary, but it should not be
necessary.
		\subsubsection{Student ID Entry}
Student ID entry is activated upon pressing the ``enter'' \Return key on an 
empty input.  That is, no characters are entered before pressing the ``enter''
\Return key.

The terminal will prompt for the user's student id, and only accepts an id
with ``{\tt860\textbackslash d\{6\}}"\footnote{You can read more about PERL
regular
 expressions (albeit, this C program does not use PERL) from PERL's online
 documentation. {\tt\url{http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html}}
} or ``{\tt861\textbackslash d\{6\}}."  When the user inputs an incorrect ID,
the user will be redirected to the primary authentication screen.
	\subsection{User Information}
The Member\_SignIn system also likes to ask the user for information.  This is
necessary to send said user coherent emails.
		\subsubsection{Last Name}
Usually, the user's last name is retrieved from a card swipe, however; this is
not the case with a direct student ID sign in.  A database lookup will also
reveal the user's last name.

Upon entering a last name that contains non-alpha characters, the user will be
forced to keep entering a last name until it finally makes sense.\
\footnote{This is probably not the best way to deal with easily frustrated
or computer-challenged users.}
		\subsubsection{First Name}
Usually, the user's first name is retrieved from a card swipe, however; this is
not the case with a direct student ID sign in.  A database lookup will also
reveal the user's first name.

Upon entering a first name that contains non-alpha characters, the user will be
forced to keep entering a first name until it finally makes sense.
		\subsubsection{Email}
A database lookup will usually reveal the user's email, but this is not the
case when the user does not have an existing record.

These emails specifically are limited to ucr.edu emails.  The PERL
verification string \footnote{This program has no PERL, but PERL is the
text processing language of choice.} should be 
``{\tt[:alphanum:]+@[alpha]*\textbackslash .?ucr\textbackslash .edu}.''
		\subsubsection{Member Number}
A database lookup should reveal the user's member number, but this is not
always the case.  The user shall be forever bothered with this unless she
already has a member number filed with the IEEE.  This is also a useful
feature for cross-referencing with official IEEE records.
	\subsection{Verification}
During this step, the user is able to change any of his or her information by
entering the bolded characters onto the terminal.

	\section{Configuration}
The program has variables.  Go change them if something looks off.

	\section{Installation}
By this point, if this is not extraneous information, C is not an interpreted
language.

	\subsection{Dependencies}

	\subsection{Compilation}

\section{Troubleshooting}
For now, your best hope is to contact your local system administrator.
Assuming that this software is not widely distributed, just call Brandon over.

In the worst-case scenario, just switch to the old member tracking method.
